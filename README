Welcome to Or√ßamento.

This is a website written in Java (using Apache Jena) to browse the Brazilian Federal Government's expenses database in RDF format.

I need a Java project manager to... manage this. Seriously, I'm just adding everything to one package and manually importing stuff with vim and so on. Please help.
