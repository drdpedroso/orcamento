*** INTRODUCTION

Welcome to OrÃ§amento.

This is a website written in Java (using Apache Jena) to browse the Brazilian Federal Government's expenses database in RDF format.

I need a Java project manager to... manage this. Seriously, I'm just adding everything to one package and manually importing stuff with vim and so on. Please help.

> ./gettdb.sh all

2. Download inflation data from the Government and populate Inflation.json

3. Compile and start the website
